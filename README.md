Overview
---

See my [Dev Blog](http://mechaelephant.com/dev/).

Mostly notes for myself in a Blog-esque presentation.

Uses a custom `docmuck` Python script to generate a static site
of Blog-like entries.
`orderedlist` is used for the theme.


Compilation
---

```bash
$ ./docmuck
```

Workflow
---

As a convention, each blog entry is stored in it's own Markdown file, with a timestamp at the end in the form:

```
###### YYYY-MM-DD
```
