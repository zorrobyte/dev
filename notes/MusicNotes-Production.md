Music Notes, Production Tips
---

From [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jS-1dMWEnIw).

* Add delay between onset of notes, especially in chord combinations, gives a more 'human' feel
* Having a shared note in a chord progression can make it sound more cohesive
* Add ambient sounds in the tonic note of your scale to fill out space (add texture)
* Fill out lead with different instruments sporadically
* Quick volume oscillations can give a 'choppy/glitch' effect
* Increase reverb in build up to increase tension
* Jumping octaves can increase interest in bassline
* Reverse sounds for more natural transitions
* Pitch slides to leads can add interest
* Add white noise to give texture to instruments (how?)
* Vary note length, especially in some way that's context aware, can help add texture
* Use atmospheric sounds that are barely perceptible to add texture

Underdog suggestions on [polymeter](youtube.com/watch?v=0SPaGLLlBsM):

> A loop whose length is not a simple multiple of 1 bar loop you are combining it with

For example, take a beat that's 8 notes to a bar and add another drum instrument, a rim, say,
at a spacing of 6 notes to the original beat.

This will have a combined repeating pattern of every 6 bars.

The addition of the additional instrument creates enough complexity to offset
the staleness of the underlying drum pattern.

Visually:

```
D : dddddddd | dddddddd | dddddddd | dddddddd | dddddddd | dddddddd | dddddddd | dddddddd | dddddddd | 
R | r.....r. | ....r... | ..r..... | r.....r. | ....r... | ..r..... | r.....r. | ....r... | ..r..... |
```

Using a synthesizer for the additional instrument, even at one note, can still be used to add
interest.

Oscar recommends doing no more than 2 instruments in polymeter as they will clash.

[Subliminal modulation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KOVs5AarmUw):

* play with release time to lengthen the same note by a bit
* Increase or decrease the pitch by a small amount
* Put a LFO on a high pass filter (on some drums, say) to give it some character making sure not to affect the core sound
  - Increase the LFO frequency so as to not make it repetitive (example was three bars)
* Duplicate a signal, pass it through various effects and then combine it with the original signal. On the duplicate:
  - put it through a reverb
  - put it through a flanger/phaser/chorus
  - play with the LFO on each effect to give slow movement (e.g. 1/3Hz)
  - make sure it's subtle

[Types of break for electronic music](youtube.com/watch?v=n3lvFEsf1O0):

* Linear break:
  - In the break, take the bass, kick or other lows out for about 8-16 bars
  - Over that time, open the filter of the synthesizer, increasing the envelope length
  - At the climax, give back all low frequency bass, keeping the open filters
  - Potentially add in a low pass filter, taking out high frequency elements at the beginning and then
    feeding them back in throughout the transition
* Trilogy break:
  - fall (vocal, pad, strings) (8-16 bars)
  - rise, more synthesizers, filters start opening up, percussion (not kick) (stay away from low end), increasing tempo (snare)
  - hang, silence (or minimal synth, voice, etc.)
  - drop, back to full energy

Shouldn't do for every song

[6 key concepts for arranging techno](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHiTUBVLmFI)


* arrange composition into about 10 16 bar segments
  - 16 bars is about 0.5 mins, so approx. 5 mins track
  - each 16 bars, change something to keep dynamism
* Shifting gears in high percussion
  - cycle through different options for high hats and other drums
  - each drum can have its own effect interpolate from the start of the phrase
    to the end to help give more power to transition
* Focus on contrast
* Markers and reverses
* Calls, responses and polymeters
* scoop-up and minimalism moments
* peforming and recording
