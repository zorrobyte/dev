        <h1 id="empirical-laws">Empirical Laws</h1>
<h3 id="conways-law">Conway's Law</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Any organization that designs a system (defined broadly) will produce a design whose structure is a copy of the organization's communication structure.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A not so clear implication is that dividing work into subgroups allows for specialization and parallelism at the cost of restricting the possibility space by imposing a communication interface between different modules of the organization chart.</p>
<p>Future organization charts inherit past organization chart structures and the resulting code ends up being a merge of the two.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_law">Wikipedia</a></p>
<h3 id="galls-law">Gall's Law</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>A complex system that works is invariably found to have evolved from a simple system that worked. A complex system designed from scratch never works and cannot be patched up to make it work. You have to start over with a working simple system.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="hanlons-razor">Hanlon's Razor</h3>

<h3 id="gervais-principle">Gervais Principle</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Sociopaths, in their own best interests, knowingly promote over-performing losers into middle-management, groom under-performing losers into sociopaths, and leave the average bare-minimum-effort losers to fend for themselves.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Note: "The Losers are not social losers (as in the opposite of “cool”), but people who have struck bad bargains economically – giving up capitalist striving for steady paychecks."</p>

<h3 id="koomeys-law">Koomey's Law</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>The number of computations per joule of energy dissipated doubled about every 1.57 years.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Note: The scaling looks to have slowed to about 2.6 years as of 2000.</p>

<h3 id="plancks-principle">Planck's Principle</h3>

<h3 id="reeds-law">Reed's Law</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>The utility of a group forming network of $n$ members scales as $O(2^n)$.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are $2^n$ subgroups of a set of $n$ members.</p>
<p>Whereas Sarnoff's law is one to many, thus linear. Metcalf's law is many to many, but only on an individual connection basis, like a telephone network. Reed's law considers subgroup formation as an added factor to the utility and points out that Metcalf's law might undervalue network effects significantly.</p>

<h3 id="sarnoffs-law">Sarnoff's Law</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>The value of a broadcast network is proportional to the number of viewers.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That is, the value of a network, in this above case a broadcast network, scales as $O(n)$.</p>

<h3 id="spolskys-observation">Spolsky's Observation</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Smart companies try to commoditize their products' complements.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Note: In this context, there are 'substitutes' and 'compliments', where a substitute is a product you buy that replaces the core product and a compliment is a product you buy with the core product.</p>

<h3 id="swansons-law">Swanson's Law</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>The price of solar photovoltaic modules tends to drop 20 percent for every doubling of cumulative shipped volume.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Note: at present, costs halve at every 10 years.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swanson&#39;s_law">Wikipedia</a></p>
<h3 id="wagners-law">Wagner's Law</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>The advent of modern industrial society will result in increasing political pressure for social progress and increased allowance for social consideration by industry.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wagner%27s_law">Wikipedia</a></p>
<h3 id="wrights-law">Wright's Law</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Production doubling leads to a constant percent decrease in cost.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>aka Experience curve effects.</p>
<p>The above is paraphrased. Wright noticed that every time total aircraft production doubled, the required labor cost fell 20%.</p>
<p>For unit number $n$, cost $P_n$ is approximately:</p>
<p>$$ P_n = P_1 n^{ \lg(\beta) } = P_1 n^{-\alpha} $$</p>
<p>Where $(1-\beta)$ is the reduction proportion and $\alpha$ is the "elasticity of cost" ($\alpha = -\lg(\beta)$). Note that $ \frac{ P_{2n} }{P_n} = 2^{-\alpha} $</p>
<p>It appears that $(1-\beta)$ estimates can typically range from $0.1$ to $0.25$.</p>
<p>Also note that economies of scale might be intertwined with with the experience curve effects and that it might be hard to separate the two.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experience_curve_effects">Wikipedia</a></p>
<h3 id="wus-razor">Wu's Razor</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>For sufficiently powerful actors, Hanlon's Razor is invoked to give malice plausible deniability.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The above is paraphrased from the original:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I've come to the conclusion Hanlon's Razor isn't particularly useful. It's catchy, popular- but as a cognitive tool it's almost never applicable and it's usually invoked not to aid the determination of truth, but as rhetorical squid ink to give malice plausible deniability.</p>
