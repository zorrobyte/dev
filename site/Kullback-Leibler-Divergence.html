        <h1 id="kullback-leibler-divergence">Kullback-Leibler Divergence</h1>
<p>Here is a short discussion of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kullback%E2%80%93Leibler_divergence">Kullback-Leibler divergence</a> that helps give some motivation for what it is an where it comes from.</p>
<p>Given two (discrete) probability distribution functions, $p(\cdot)$ and $q(\cdot)$, the Kullback-Leibler divergence is defined as:</p>
<p>$$ D_{KL}(p || q) = - \sum_{x} p(x) \ln(\frac{p(x)}{q(x)}) $$</p>
<p>The Kullback-Leibler divergence, in some intuitive sense, measures the difference between probability distributions.</p>
<p>As motivation, consider a situation where you are providing internet service to a business. This business wants to compress their data but has, incorrectly, guessed at a distribution $q(x)$ for the symbols it's trying to transmit.</p>
<p>If you've determined the true distribution to be $p(x)$ the question is, how much is the gain you get by, say, charging the business for compressing their data with the probability distribution $q(x)$ when you have knowledge and can use the true distribution $p(x)$.</p>
<p>The business will encode it's messages with an average of</p>
<p>$$ -\sum_{x} p(x) \lg(q(x)) $$</p>
<p>bits, where the $\lg(q(x))$ is the encoded bit size of the token $x$ but will only happen with the true underlying distribution $p(x)$. If you take the messages and re-encode them properly, the average bit size will be:</p>
<p>$$ -\sum_{x} p(x) \lg(p(x)) $$</p>
<p>Taking the difference:</p>
<p>$$ \begin{array}{cl} &amp; -\sum_{x} p(x) \lg(p(x)) - [-\sum_{x} p(x) \lg(q(x) ] \\ \to &amp; -\sum_{x} p(x) \lg( \frac{p(x)}{q(x)}) \end{array} $$</p>
<p>On average, $D_{KL}(p || q)$ bits per token are saved. If the business is willing to pay rates based on the bits they see going out, namely $-\sum_{x} p(x) \lg(q(x))$, but you're paying only for $-\sum_{x} p(x) \lg(p(x))$ bits going out, then there's potential profit on the difference to be made.</p>
<hr />
<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-entropy">cross entropy</a> is a concept closely connected to the Kullback-Leibler distribution.</p>
<p>The cross entropy is defined as:</p>
<p>$$ H(p,q) = -\sum_{x} p(x) \lg(q(x)) $$</p>
<p>The Kullback-Leibler distribution can be seen as the difference of the entropy of the distribution $p(\cdot)$ and the cross entropy of $p(\cdot)$ and $q(\cdot)$:</p>
<p>$$ \begin{array}{cl} D_{KL} &amp; = H(p) - H(p,q) \\ &amp; = -\sum_{x} p(x) \lg(\frac{p(x)}{q(x)}) \end{array} $$</p>
<p>In the above example, the cross entropy is how many bits the business is transmitting under their fallacious assumption of $q(\cdot)$ as the distribution and the entropy of $p(\cdot)$ is the "optimized" bits you transmit with knowledge of the underlying distribution.</p>
<hr />
<p>When given a "guess" distribution, $q(x)$, one can compare how "bad" it is compared with a "true" or underlying distribution, $p(x)$.</p>
